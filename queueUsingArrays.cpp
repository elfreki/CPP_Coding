class Queue {
	/*
	Summary
	-------
	Create a class to implement Queue(circular) using dynamically created array.

	Extended Summary
	----------------
	This is a class definition of a Queue(Circular) which is created using a
	dynamically created array. By dynamically created array, we means that the
	array will be created when it is to be used and deleted afterwards.
	The queue will be circular in nature i.e, the `head` index will be at index
	`rear`+1.

	Parameters
	----------
	None

	Returns
	-------
	None

	Description
	-----------
	Class definition

	Approach
	--------
	Class definition provides data member and member functions for the Queue
	class.

	int count;									// Current size of the Q

	Queue(int size = SIZE);			// Constructor
	~Queue();										// Destructor
	void dequeue();							// Deleting the element.
	void enqueue(int);					// Inserting the element.
	int peek();  								// Returns front element
	int size();									// Returns current size of Q.

	Summary
	-------
	Create a constructor for Queue class.

	Extended Summary
	----------------
	This is a constructor definition of a Queue class. This constructor
	initializes the class variables and alloted memory space for the
	them. It also creates the dynamic array. A Constructor definition
	is necessary because of it's importance in memory allotment.

	Parameters
	----------
	size : int type, tells about the memory alloted to the array being
	initialized.

	Returns
	-------
	None

	Description
	-----------
	Queue Constructor definition.

	Approach
	--------
	Constructor definition provides information of data member when they are
	being initialized at compile time.
